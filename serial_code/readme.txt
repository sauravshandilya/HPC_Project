=======================
Using makefile to compile and execute code:
1. make -> to compile the code
2. make run -> to execute the code. Uses training.txt as training dataset and test_full.txt as test dataset with 12 PCA
3. make avgtime -> to execute code 10 times and compute average time
4. make clean -> clean executable files
