compilation:
g++ main.cpp io.cpp calculations.cpp -Wall -Wextra -Iusr/local/include/opencv2 -lopencv_core -lopencv_imgcodecs

executing program (where the components can explain the training data with 0.99 accuracy)
./a.out "./input/training.txt" "./input/test.txt" 0.99

executing program (where we use 12 principal components)
./a.out "./input/training.txt" "./input/test.txt" 12

The input files can be given by the relative path to the bianry or with full path.
The file paths in the input files have to also be full or relative to the binary file.
